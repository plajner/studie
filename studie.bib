abstract = {Bayesian networks are graphical modeling tools that have been proven very powerful in a variety of application contexts. The purpose of this paper is to provide education practitioners with the background and examples needed to understand Bayesian networks and use them to design and implement student models. The student model is the key component of any adaptive tutoring system, as it stores all the information about the student (for example, knowledge, interest, learning styles, etc.) so the tutoring system can use this information to provide personalized instruction. Basic and advanced concepts and techniques are introduced and applied in the context of typical student modeling problems. A repertoire of models of varying complexity is discussed. To illustrate the proposed methodology a Bayesian Student Model for the Simplex algorithm is developed.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a junction tree based inference architecture exploiting the structure of the original Bayesian network and independence relations induced by evidence to improve the efficiency of inference. The efficiency improvements are obtained by maintaining a multiplicative decomposition of clique and separator potentials. Maintaining a multiplicative decomposition of clique and separator potentials offers a tradeoff between off-line constructed junction trees and on-line exploitation of barren variables and independence relations induced by evidence. We consider the impact of the proposed architecture on a number of commonly performed Bayesian network tasks. The tasks we consider include cautious propagations of evidence, determining a most probable configuration, and past retraction of evidence a long with a number of other tasks. The general impression is that the proposed architecture increases the computational efficiency of performing these tasks. The efficiency improvement offered by the proposed architecture is emphasized through empirical evaluations involving the large real-world Bayesian networks. We compare the time and space performance the proposed architecture with non-optimize implementation of the HUGIN and Shafer-Shenoy inference architectures.},

abstract = {Three applications of computerized adaptive testing (CAT) to help solve problems encountered in educational settings are described and discussed. Each of these applications makes use of item response theory to select test questions from an item pool to estimate a student's achievement level and its precision. These estimates may then be used in conjunction with certain testing strategies to facilitate certain educational decisions. The three applications considered are (a) adaptive mastery testing for determining whether or not a student has mastered a particular content area, (b) adaptive grading for assigning grades to students, and (c) adaptive self-referenced testing for estimating change in a student's achievement level. Differences between currently used classroom procedures and these CAT procedures are discussed. For the adaptive mastery testing procedure, evidence from a series of studies comparing conventional and adaptive testing procedures is presented showing that the adaptive procedure results in more accurate mastery classifications than do conventional mastery tests, while using fewer test questions.},

In computer adaptive testing (CAT), tests are automatically tailored to the proficiency level of the individual examinees. Currently, nearly all large-scale testing programs in the western world are already adaptive or in the process of becoming so. Written by active CAT researchers from Europe and North America, the chapters offer a comprehensive introduction to the latest developments in the theory and practice of CAT. The book can be used both as a basic reference on the state of the art in CAT and a valuable resource in graduate courses on test theory. The theoretical chapters in this book cover such topics as item selection and ability estimation, item pool development and maintenance, item calibration and model fit, and testlet-based adaptive testing. The practical chapters describe the operational aspects of existing large-scale CAT programs.},

Participants took a computer-adaptive test in which 2 features, difficulty of the initial item and difficulty of subsequent items, were manipulated, then responded to questionnaires assessing their reactions to the test. The data show that the relationship between a test's objective difficulty, which was determined by the 2 manipulated test characteristics, and reactions was fully mediated by perceived performance. Additional analyses evaluated the impact of feedback on reactions to the adaptive test. In general, feedback that was consistent with perceptions of performance was positively related to reactions. The results suggest that minor changes to the design of an adaptive test may potentially enhance examinees' reactions.},
